# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown? 

Markdown is a handy tool that works like a bare bones version of HTML. It allows you to add formatting elements to a plaintext document and view it in a display area

## Why use Markdown? 

Markdown appears to be a good starting point when getting to grips with languages like HTML as it allows you to format a page without any prior coding knowledge. It's designed to be easy to read and write and allows you to play around with basic formatting such as:

# Headings
using a single # key to create the largest heading, or more to create smaller headings 

- bullet
- points
  
using the dash key

**bold text**

using two asterisks'

_italics_

using underscores

Markdown offers further advantages such as the flexibility of being able to use it quickly and easily with any computing system, and is completely free to all users! üòé


You can create links really easily too! For example, here is a link to the escape room I work at, [Breakout Liverpool](https://breakoutliverpool.com) 
by simply writing the link text in square brackets and the URL in rounded ones.
