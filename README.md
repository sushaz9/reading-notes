## To have a growth mindset is to believe that your abilities can be improved through effort and hard-work, and not simply talent. Having the ability to embrace challenges and keep going is an example of a good growth mindset. 

### To maintain a positive growth mindset I should 

- communicate with tutors and those around me
- avoid distractions, but know it's ok to step away for a moment 
- reflect
- accept that mistakes are **normal**! and *useful*!
